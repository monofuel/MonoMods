TO BUILD:

dependencies:
	ant
	JDK 1.7+
	craftbukkit 1.7.10 API
	java mongodb driver

any JDK 1.7+ should work, this project was developed and tested on IcedTea 1.7.0
compiled on a gentoo system.

if you have and and the jdk installed and properly on your path,
you should be able to build by simply running 'ant'.

It's recommended that you keep the latest bukkit API jar in bin/
the japura.net plugins are typically built and tested against the dev builds.

no warrenty is given for building on a windows system, however the build.xml
file should be perfectly fine for importing into an IDE like netbeans or eclipse.

place the latest version of the bukkit API in bin/
place a copy of the mongodb driver jar in bin/

to TEST:

remember, the aperture science bring your daughter to work day is the perfect
time to have her tested.

include the latest bukkit jar in ../dev
after you've built the plugins, you can copy the plugins into ../dev/plugins
or use push.sh to simply copy them all over.

then you should just have to execute the bukkit jar in the testing directory
to start up a server on your machine to test it.
