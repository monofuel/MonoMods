//Monofuel 2014

This "MonoMods" package is a custom package of plugins for the japura.net server. In the interest of code quality, the complete code
and build process will be public on github to encourage critiqueing and improvements.

included files and directories:

TODO.txt: list of things on the to-do list
BUILD.txt: build and testing instructions
build.xml: ant build file
push.sh: script to push built plugins into test/plugins
LICENSE.txt: BSD license that any software written by monofuel for this project is included under.

bin: currently only for jar files to include documentation
build: built class files
dist: final jars to distribute
docs: web-readable documentation for the plugins generated by the ant build process
src/japura: source for the japura.net server plugins
src/org/json: source for the simple JSON parser
test: directory for a testing server

USAGE:

follow the instructions in BUILD.txt to compile and test the plugins.
all the plugins require the MonoUtil.jar plugin. MonoUtil includes shared classes that all the other
plugins rely on. This might not be the best setup, and has not been heavily stress tested. I give no warrenty to
updating monoUtil without a server restart, but it should be fine in theory

LICENSE:

Anything in src/japura/* is included under the modified BSD license included.
all software in src/japura/* was written by monofuel for japura.net, with the exception of one
or two lines that may have been shamelessly stolen from stackoverflow. EG: crazy regular expressions or
the like. I'd rather not burden myself with the horror of inventing and debugging my own regexes.
Anything in src/org/json/simple/* is included under the apache license included at 
src/org/json/simple/LICENSE.txt. json-simple is entirely unmodified and is only included
for a simplified build process and documetation.
