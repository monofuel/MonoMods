THINGS TO TEST:
everything

test how bugs and tribes react when the db isn't running
fail-safe to lock the server down if tribes doesn't load right

MonoCities respawning chests

vote rewards

selective inventory restore on death should be
definable in the config
tribes should let players respawn at spawn diamond

custom or stub commands
	/kit should either give a kit or not, i'm not the boss



IRC moderation
moderate irc from in-game

Error with tribes:
	acted funky with "could not pass event" on first load

general plugin thing:
	periodically flush to config
